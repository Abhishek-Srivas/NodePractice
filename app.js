const http = require('http'); //const because we are not gonna change it, reuire is simply a way how you import file in js and http will search for global if i would have written / or ./ http then it would search file in local

const routes = require('./routes');

const server = http.createServer(routes);   // this will be called when ever a request reaches node js server
// request listner recives a request and gives us a object response to return a response  

//oon running it will give nothing beacause createserver return a server so we have to store it and then listen it,listen will not terminate the code and will wait and listen  
server.listen(3000);
